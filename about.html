            We are Jane Flex and John Doe, and we started Blooms as a way to provide the healthiest
            local flowers for everyone to be confident that they are getting the best bouqets for
            their loved ones and special events. After years of experimenting with different kinds
            of organic growing methods and comfortable environments, we have settled on a formula 
            that is guaranteed to bring out beautiful floral wonders for you.

                I have had a deep passion for studying the visually and structurally complex design of flowers 
                since my childhood. Each type has played its part in Earth's history with a significant 
                message to convey, and I enjoy using them like a wordless language to display all sorts of 
                meanings in the bouqets I design. When I am not spending my time near stems and petals, I
                usually camp, hike, and read books.

                    Painting has been my main focus for the majority of my career. It was not until 7 years ago I tried
                    gardening during a search for a new skill to learn when I became entranced by the art of floristry. 
                    Since then, I've been using my experience from representing the world on canvas boards along with 
                    a simple knowledge of cultivating flowers to maintain colorful, vivid species clients would love.
                    Outside of flowers, I love to travel, cycle, and do photography.
